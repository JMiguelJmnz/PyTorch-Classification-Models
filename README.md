## PyTorch-Classification-Models
A series of PyTorch-based projects focused on applying classification techniques across multiple data types, including tabular data, images, audio, and text. Each project explores a specific pipeline—from preprocessing to training and evaluation—providing hands-on experience with deep learning in real-world contexts.

### 1.- Tabular Data Classification:
Built and trained a deep learning model (feedforward neural network) for binary classification to distinguish between different rice grain types using structured tabular data.

### 2.- Image Classification:
Developed a neural network for image classification using the PyTorch framework to automatically categorize animal images into three predefined classes: dog, cat, and wild.

### 3.- Pre-trained models
Applied transfer learning by fine-tuning a pretrained image classification model on a dataset of bean leaf lesions. The model classifies images into one of three categories: healthy, angular_leaf_spot, or bean_rust.

### 4.- Audio Classification
Implemented an end-to-end audio classification pipeline using a dataset of Quran recitations. Audio files were converted into mel spectrograms and labeled for supervised learning.

### 5.- Text Classification
Built a text classification model using the Hugging Face transformers library with AutoTokenizer and AutoModel for embedding generation. The model was trained to detect sarcasm in news headlines using binary classification.

Each project is organized into its own directory, providing modular and focused implementations.​
